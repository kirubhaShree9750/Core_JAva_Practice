interval problem:
birth to death 
if minimum value is 1950 - year and increment ++


Now max value is 0 and first value of 1
mminimum 1950 +2

Rotation by 90:

Assign column to row
1st column to 1 st row

mat[i][j]= mat[arrayLen-1-j][i]


Two sum 
Complement = target - input
To find the sum if complement is already there in map then targetSum = input+Complement find the imdexss
