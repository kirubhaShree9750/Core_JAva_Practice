Java StringBuffer class is used to create mutable (modifiable) String objects. The StringBuffer class in Java is the same as String class except it is mutable i.e. it can be changed.

Note: Java StringBuffer class is thread-safe i.e. multiple threads cannot access it simultaneously. So it is safe and will result in an order.

Java StringBuilder Class
Java StringBuilder class is used to create mutable (modifiable) String. The Java StringBuilder class is same as StringBuffer class except that it is non-synchronized

StringBuffer() and StringBuilder()	It creates an empty String Builder with the initial capacity of 16.

No.	String	                        StringBuffer
1)	The String class is immutable.	The StringBuffer class is mutable.
2)	String is slow and consumes more memory when we concatenate too many strings because every time it creates new instance.	StringBuffer is fast and consumes less memory when we concatenate t strings.
3)	String class overrides the equals() method of Object class. So you can compare the contents of two strings by equals() method.	StringBuffer class doesn't override the equals() method of Object class.
4)	String class is slower while performing concatenation operation.	StringBuffer class is faster while performing concatenation operation.
5)	String class uses String constant pool.	StringBuffer uses Heap memory


No.	StringBuffer	StringBuilder
1)	StringBuffer is synchronized i.e. thread safe. It means two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously.	StringBuilder is non-synchronized i.e. not thread safe. It means two threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously.
2)	StringBuffer is less efficient than StringBuilder.	StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer.
3)	StringBuffer was introduced in Java 1.0	StringBuilder was introduced in Java 1.5


How to create Immutable class?
There are many immutable classes like String, Boolean, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double etc. In short, all the wrapper classes and String class is immutable. We can also create immutable class by creating final class that have final data members as the example given below:

Example to create Immutable class
In this example, we have created a final class named Employee. It have one final datamember, a parameterized constructor and getter method.

ImmutableDemo.java

public final class Employee  
{    
final String pancardNumber;    
public Employee(String pancardNumber)  
{    
this.pancardNumber=pancardNumber;    
}  
public String getPancardNumber(){    
return pancardNumber;    
}    
}    
public class ImmutableDemo  
{  
public static void main(String ar[])  
{  
Employee e = new Employee("ABC123");  
String s1 = e.getPancardNumber();  
System.out.println("Pancard Number: " + s1);  
}  
}

The above class is immutable because:

The instance variable of the class is final i.e. we cannot change the value of it after creating an object.
The class is final so we cannot create the subclass.
There is no setter methods i.e. we have no option to change the value of the instance variable


Java toString() Method:

 you want to represent any object as a string, toString() method comes into existence.

The toString() method returns the String representation of the object.

If you print any object, Java compiler internally invokes the toString() method on the object. So overriding the toString() method, returns the desired output, it can be the state of an object etc. depending on your implementation

class Student{  
 int rollno;  
 String name;  
 String city;  
  
 Student(int rollno, String name, String city){  
 this.rollno=rollno;  
 this.name=name;  
 this.city=city;  
 }  
  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   Student s1=new Student(101,"Raj","lucknow");  
   Student s2=new Student(102,"Vijay","ghaziabad");  
     
   System.out.println(s1);//compiler writes here s1.toString()  
   System.out.println(s2);//compiler writes here s2.toString()  
 }  
}  

Output:

Student@1fee6fc
Student@1eed786

class Student{  
 int rollno;  
 String name;  
 String city;  
  
 Student(int rollno, String name, String city){  
 this.rollno=rollno;  
 this.name=name;  
 this.city=city;  
 }  
 public String toString(){//overriding the toString() method  
  return rollno+" "+name+" "+city;  
 }  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   Student s1=new Student(101,"Raj","lucknow");  
   Student s2=new Student(102,"Vijay","ghaziabad");  
     
   System.out.println(s1);//compiler writes here s1.toString()  
   System.out.println(s2);//compiler writes here s2.toString()  
 }  
}  

indexOf():
The Java String class indexOf() method returns the position of the first occurrence of the specified character or string in a specified string.

Signature
There are four overloaded indexOf() method in Java. The signature of indexOf() methods are given below:

No.	Method	Description
1	int indexOf(int ch)	It returns the index position for the given char value
2	int indexOf(int ch, int fromIndex)	It returns the index position for the given char value and from index
3	int indexOf(String substring)	It returns the index position for the given substring
4	int indexOf(String substring, int fromIndex)	

if the start index is negative value
end index is lower than starting index.
Either starting or ending index is greater than the total number of characters present in the string.

public class SubstringExample{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
String s1="javatpoint";  
System.out.println(s1.substring(2,4));//returns va  
System.out.println(s1.substring(2));//returns vatpoint  
}}
