Method overloading:
In Java, Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only.
Can we overload java main() method?
Yes, by method overloading. You can have any number of main methods in a class by method overloading. But JVM calls main() method which receives string array as arguments only. Let's see the simple example:

class TestOverloading4{  
public static void main(String[] args){System.out.println("main with String[]");}  
public static void main(String args){System.out.println("main with String");}  
public static void main(){System.out.println("main without args");}  

Example of Method Overloading with Type Promotion in case of ambiguity

If there are no matching type arguments in the method, and each method promotes similar number of arguments, there will be ambiguity.

class OverloadingCalculation3{  
  void sum(int a,long b){System.out.println("a method invoked");}  
  void sum(long a,int b){System.out.println("b method invoked");}  
  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  OverloadingCalculation3 obj=new OverloadingCalculation3();  
  obj.sum(20,20);//now ambiguity  
  }  
}  


One type is not de-promoted implicitly for example double cannot be depromoted to any type implicitly.


Example of Method Overloading with Type Promotion if matching found
If there are matching type arguments in the method, type promotion is not performed.

class OverloadingCalculation2{  
  void sum(int a,int b){System.out.println("int arg method invoked");}  
  void sum(long a,long b){System.out.println("long arg method invoked");}  
  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  OverloadingCalculation2 obj=new OverloadingCalculation2();  
  obj.sum(20,20);//now int arg sum() method gets invoked  
  }  
}  

Output:int arg method invoked
