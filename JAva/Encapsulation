Encapsulation in Java:

Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private. Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.
The Java Bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.

Advantage of Encapsulation in Java

The encapsulate class is easy to test. So, it is better for unit testing.

//A Account class which is a fully encapsulated class.  
//It has a private data member and getter and setter methods.  
class Account {  
//private data members  
private long acc_no;  
private String name,email;  
private float amount;  
//public getter and setter methods  
public long getAcc_no() {  
    return acc_no;  
}  
public void setAcc_no(long acc_no) {  
    this.acc_no = acc_no;  
}  
public String getName() {  
    return name;  
}  
public void setName(String name) {  
    this.name = name;  
}  
public String getEmail() {  
    return email;  
}  
public void setEmail(String email) {  
    this.email = email;  
}  
public float getAmount() {  
    return amount;  
}  
public void setAmount(float amount) {  
    this.amount = amount;  
}  
  
}
