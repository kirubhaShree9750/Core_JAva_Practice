if-else , if-elseif-else ,nested if 
switch With break and without break, switch with enum
loops ->  for loop -> loops are used to itierate parts of program several times, fixed number of iterations
while loop -> number of iterations are not fixed
do while -> execute loop atleast once and number of iterations are not fixed
Infite loop
for(;;){  
//code to be executed  
}  

//Java For-each loop example which prints the  
//elements of the array  
public class ForEachExample {  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
    //Declaring an array  
    int arr[]={12,23,44,56,78};  
    //Printing array using for-each loop  
    for(int i:arr){  
        System.out.println(i);  
    }  
}  


Break:

The Java break statement is used to break loop or switch statement. 
It breaks the current flow of the program at specified condition. In case of inner loop, it breaks only inner loop.

constructor: A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized
Note: We can use access modifiers while declaring a constructor.
It controls the object creation. In other words, we can have private, protected, public or default constructor in Java.

Q) What is the purpose of a default constructor?
The default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null, etc., depending on the type.
