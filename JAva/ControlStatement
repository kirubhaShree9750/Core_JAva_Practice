if-else , if-elseif-else ,nested if 
switch With break and without break, switch with enum
loops ->  for loop -> loops are used to itierate parts of program several times, fixed number of iterations
while loop -> number of iterations are not fixed
do while -> execute loop atleast once and number of iterations are not fixed
Infite loop
for(;;){  
//code to be executed  
}  

//Java For-each loop example which prints the  
//elements of the array  
public class ForEachExample {  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
    //Declaring an array  
    int arr[]={12,23,44,56,78};  
    //Printing array using for-each loop  
    for(int i:arr){  
        System.out.println(i);  
    }  
}  


Break:

The Java break statement is used to break loop or switch statement. 
It breaks the current flow of the program at specified condition. In case of inner loop, it breaks only inner loop.

constructor: A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized
Note: We can use access modifiers while declaring a constructor.
It controls the object creation. In other words, we can have private, protected, public or default constructor in Java.

Q) What is the purpose of a default constructor?
The default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null, etc., depending on the type.

Constructor can be overloaded even if they don't have objects with different parameters



Java Constructor	                                           Java Method
A constructor is used to initialize the state of an object.	A method is used to expose the behavior of an object.
A constructor must not have a return type.	A method must have a return type.
The constructor is invoked implicitly.	The method is invoked explicitly.
The Java compiler provides a default constructor if you don't have any constructor in a class.	The method is not provided by the compiler in any case.
The constructor name must be same as the class name.	The method name may or may not be same as the class name.


Does constructor return any value?
Yes, it is the current class instance (You cannot use return type yet it returns a value).

Static block: called before main

instance variable
we have created an instance variable named count which is incremented in the constructor.
Since instance variable gets the memory at the time of object creation, each object will have the copy of the instance variable.

Static variable:
static variable will get the memory only once during compile time , 
if any object changes the value of the static variable, it will retain its value.

Restrictions for the static method

There are two main restrictions for the static method. They are:

The static method can not use non static data member or call non-static method directly.
this and super cannot be used in static context.

this:
this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.
this can be passed as an argument in the method call.
this can be passed as argument in the constructor call.
this can be used to return the current class instance from the method.
