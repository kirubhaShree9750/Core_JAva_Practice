Collections:
The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

ArrayList:

- Stores duplicate elemet
- Maintains insertion order and non -synchronized
- It;s non-synchronized
- It uses dynamic array to store eleemts
- Java allows random access because array works index basis

Internal implementation:
- Size of arrayList is fixed but you can update size
- input first time set initial size and if you want to add other 4 eleemnts .it will create a new list of new size to accomdate elements.
- it will copy old elements to new elements and delete old eleements 
- so manipulation of array list is slower

LinkedList:
-It uses doubly linked list to store elements
- Maintains insertion order and non-synchronized
- Manipulation is fast
Vector
- Synchronized 
- Uses dynamic array to store elements
Stack
The stack is the subclass of Vector. It implements the last-in-first-out data structure
