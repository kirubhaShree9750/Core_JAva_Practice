Collections:
The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

ArrayList:

- Stores duplicate elemet
- Maintains insertion order and non -synchronized
- It;s non-synchronized
- It uses dynamic array to store eleemts
- Java allows random access because array works index basis

Internal implementation:
- Size of arrayList is fixed but you can update size
- input first time set initial size and if you want to add other 4 eleemnts .it will create a new list of new size to accomdate elements.
- it will copy old elements to new elements and delete old eleements 
- so manipulation of array list is slower

LinkedList:
-It uses doubly linked list to store elements
- Maintains insertion order and non-synchronized
- Manipulation is fast
Vector
- Synchronized 
- Uses dynamic array to store elements
Stack
The stack is the subclass of Vector. It implements the last-in-first-out data structure

Array
) ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements.	LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
2) Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed from the array, all the other elements are shifted in memory.	Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory.
3) An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.	LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.
4) ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.	LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
5) The memory location for the elements of an ArrayList is contiguous.	The location for the elements of a linked list is not contagious.
6) Generally, when an ArrayList is initialized, a default capacity of 10 is assigned to the ArrayList.	There is no case of default capacity in a LinkedList. In LinkedList, an empty list is created when a LinkedList is initialized.
7) To be precise, an ArrayList is a resizable array.	LinkedList implements the doubly linked list of the list interface.
